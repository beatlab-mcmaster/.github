# BEAT Lab GitHub Organization
This organization contains public and private (work-in-progress) repositories affiliated with the Brain/Body, Entrainment, Attention, &amp; Timing Lab (BEAT Lab) at McMaster University, led by Prof. [Dr. Lauren Fink](https://experts.mcmaster.ca/display/finkl1). You can learn more about the lab, our members, and our research, on our lab website: [https://beatlab.mcmaster.ca/](https://beatlab.mcmaster.ca/)

The lab is committed to openscience and reproducible code. All lab projects from 2024 onwards will be have accompanying code repositories hosted here. 

Feel free to look around, build on what we've built and open any issues when you find them!
